If you want your macros run fast, add the following two lines at the beginning of your code.

	Application.ScreenUpdating = False 
	Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual


Don't forget to switch ScreenUpdating and Calculation properties at the end of your code.
If you don't you can't see your changes applied while dealing with formulas and this might goes you mad.

Insert the following at the end of your code, right before End Sub.

	Application.ScreenUpdating = True
	Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic
